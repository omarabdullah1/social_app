# social_app

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Flutter e-Commerce application using Bloc, Firebase, and shared preferences.

Login and register screens with form validation and shared preferences to save userâ€™s token to see if he/she logged before so the app navigates directly to the home screen. Beautiful home screen To Show Posts For Friends, Chats, and Settings. The bottom navigation bar moves fast between screens. And finally, the settings screen so you can change your data or sign out.
